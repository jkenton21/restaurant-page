# restaurant-page

The purpose of this project is to create a website for a restaurant that has a home page, a menu page, and a contact page.

However, the trick for this website is that the contents of the site will be 100% created using DOM manipulation. The HTML file will only include the header with links to the CSS and JS files and then a body with a container 'div' for the entire contents of the site.

Furthermore, javascript modules will be used for the different pages and webpack will be used to package everything up for the html file to utilize.
